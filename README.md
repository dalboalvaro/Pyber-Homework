Observable Trends
- There is a concentration of drivers in urban areas, comprising 80% of the drivers. From the remainder 20%, only 2.6% are in rural areas
- The demand for rides by city types is not proportionasl to the distribution of drivers:
  68% of the rides requested to Pyber come from urban areas, while 26% from suburban and nearly 6% from rural areas
- Average fares are tipically higher in rural areas than in urban areas. While the information on average distance of rides is not 
  available, it can be assumed that this is caused by a combination of the higher scarcity of drivers in rural areas than in urban ones, 
  allowing drivers in rural areas to charge comparatively higher fares, and average distances driven. Tipically, there is a larger proportion
  of short rides in urban areas than in rural areas, and it can be observed in the data available that there is a higher concentration 
  of small ticket rides in urban areas than in rural areas that corroborate this assumption.
